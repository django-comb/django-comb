# Django Comb

Django Comb is a command-line tool aimed at untangling Django Models.

It provides a `lint_models` management command. This is a linter, allowing developers to define rules about their models.

Currently, the only rule is the `no-inbound-foreign-keys` rule, which prevents other models from defining `ForeignKey`,
`OneToOneField` or `ManyToManyField` into a given model.

## Usage

### 1. Install `django_comb`

Ensure `django_comb` is on the Python path and add it to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
# myproject/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
   "django_comb",
   ...
]
```

###  2. Define rules

- Choose an _installed_ Django app to place your rules. (It doesn't matter functionally, but usually you will want to
  use the app that contains the models you are protecting.)
- Create a `model_rules.toml` in the directory in that app, alongside the app's `models.py`.
- Add one or more rule definitions, in the form `[rule.my-rule-id]`. The second part of the TOML key (after the `.`)
  is your rule's unique id. See [Supported Rules](#supported-rules) for examples.

### 3. Run the linter

Run the `lint_models` management command:

```text
python manage.py lint_models
```

## Supported rules

### No inbound foreign keys

Prevents other models from defining a `ForeignKey`, `OneToOneField` or `ManyToManyField` into a set of models.

| TOML Key              | Type                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`                | String                                | The rule type, must be `"no_inbound_foreign_keys"`.                                                                                                            |
| `models`              | String or Array of Strings            | The models to protect against inbound foreign keys pointing to them from other models, in the form  `app_label.ModelName`. Supports Unix shell-style wildcards. |
| `allowed`   | String or Array of Strings (optional) | Models that are allowed to point to `models`, in the form `app_label.ModelName`. Supports Unix shell-style wildcards.                                          |
| `silenced_violations` | String or Array of Strings (optional) | Functionally identical to `allowed`, but indicates undesirable dependencies. Supports Unix shell-style wildcards.                                    |

#### Example

```toml
# path/to/some_app/model_rules.toml

[rule.no-fks-to-blue-or-green]
type = "no_inbound_foreign_keys"
models = "some_app.*"  # All models in some_app.
allowed = [
    # It's okay for these models to have a foreign key
    # to the models above.
    "some_app.*",
    "another_app.Orange",
]
# Models listed here also point to the models above, but they shouldn't.
# Including them here suppresses violations in the same way as
# `allowed`, but indicates that the violation is technical debt
# rather than intentional design.
silenced_violations = "another_app.Purple"
```

# Exit codes

`lint_models` exits with the following status codes:

- `0` if no violations were found.
- `1` if violations were found.
- `2` if it terminates abnormally, e.g. due to invalid configuration.


## The `get_model_rules` command

To view the discovered model rules as JSON, run the `get_model_rules` management command:

```text
$ python manage.py get_model_rules
[
  {
    "id": "all",
    "app_label": "another_app",
    "type": "no_inbound_foreign_keys",
    "models": [
      "some_app.*"
    ],
    "allowed": [
      "some_app.*",
      "another_app.Pur*"
    ],
    "silenced_violations": [
      "another_*.Orange"
    ],
    "extra_key_one": "foo",
    "extra_key_two": "bar"
  },
  {
    "id": "some-app-yellow",
    "app_label": "some_app",
    "type": "no_inbound_foreign_keys",
    "models": [
      "some_app.Yellow"
    ]
  }
]
```

This can be useful for building secondary tooling that tracks, say, the number of `silenced_violations` over time.
